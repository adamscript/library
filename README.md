# Library

**Live Demo :** [awwwan.github.io/library](https://awwwan.github.io/library/)

I made this project to learn about Javascript Object and Constructor.

Ended up learning much more. I learned more about flex, grid, how to center a div, using third party API (Google Books), a little about how promise (and async) works and how it's different compared to synchronous, and last but not least I learned how to make cool looking UI/UX. :)

All done with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
